# Description of Short-Time Fourier Transform
The **short-time Fourier transform** (**STFT**), is a [Fourier-related transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Fourier-related_transforms "List of Fourier-related transforms") used to determine the sinusoidal frequency and phase content of local sections of a signal as it changes over time.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-time_Fourier_transform#cite_note-1) In practice, the procedure for computing STFTs is to divide a longer time signal into shorter segments of equal length and then compute the Fourier transform separately on each shorter segment. This reveals the Fourier spectrum on each shorter segment. One then usually plots the changing spectra as a function of time, known as a [spectrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram "Spectrogram") or waterfall plot, such as commonly used in [software defined radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Defined_Radio "Software Defined Radio") (SDR) based spectrum displays. Full bandwidth displays covering the whole range of an SDR commonly use fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) with 2^24 points on desktop computers.
## Main types
### Continuous
Simply, in the continuous-time case, the function to be transformed is multiplied by a [window function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function "Window function") which is nonzero for only a short period of time. The [Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform "Fourier transform") (a one-dimensional function) of the resulting signal is taken, then the window is slid along the time axis until the end resulting in a two-dimensional representation of the signal.
### Discrete
In the discrete time case, the data to be transformed could be broken up into chunks or frames (which usually overlap each other, to reduce artifacts at the boundary). Each chunk is [Fourier transformed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform "Fourier transform"), and the complex result is added to a matrix, which records magnitude and phase for each point in time and frequency.
### Sliding
If only a small number of Ï‰ are desired, or if the STFT is desired to be evaluated for every shift _m_ of the window, then the STFT may be more efficiently evaluated using a [sliding DFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_DFT "Sliding DFT") algorithm
